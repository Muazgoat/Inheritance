# Inheritance Example

This Java program demonstrates inheritance using the `Car` and `SpecificCar` classes.

## Description

The program consists of two classes:

- `Car`: Represents a generic car with basic functionalities like honking the horn and accelerating.
- `SpecificCar`: Extends `Car` class and represents a specific type of car. It overrides the `pressHorn` method to make a different horn sound and adds a method to get the model of the car.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the `Inheritance1` class.
3. The program will create a `SpecificCar` object, invoke its methods, and display the make and model of the car.
